### A Motivating Example

- Does eating ice cream make people happier?

- Suppose we conduct a survey and obtain the following results:

Respondent    | Eats Ice Cream?     | Happy?
-             | -                   | -
Andrew        | 1                   | 1
Barbara       | 1                   | 1
Charlotte     | 1                   | 1
Denis         | 0                   | 0
Eric          | 0                   | 1
Fabian        | 0                   | 0


&lt;br&gt;

- Is eating ice cream **correlated** with happiness?  

- Does eating ice cream **cause** happiness?

---

### Causality and Potential Outcomes

- To measure the **causal effect** of ice cream, we need to observe happiness in two (counterfactual) states of the world:

&lt;br&gt;

Respondent   | Happiness if Eis        |  Happiness if No Eis     |   Difference
-            | -                       | -                         |   -  
Andrew       | 1                       | 1                         |   0
Barbara      | 1                       | 0                         |   1
Charlotte    | 1                       | 1                         |   0
Denis        | 0                       | 0                         |   0
Eric         | 0                       | 1                         |   -1
Fabian       | 0                       | 0                         |   0     

&lt;br&gt;

- The **difference** column displays the **causal effect** of ice cream consumption.


---

### Some (hopefully helpful) notation

- **Treatment variable** `\(D\)`: ice cream consumption 

  - `\(D_i\)`: Value of `\(D\)` for individual `\(i\)` (.pink[1] = treatment = ice cream; .blue[0] = control = no ice cream) 

&lt;br&gt;    
--

- **Outcome variable** *Y*: happiness

  - `\(Y_i\)`(.pink[1]): Potential outcome for individual `\(i\)` when `\(D\)` = .pink[1]
  
  - `\(Y_i\)`(.blue[0]): Potential outcome for individual `\(i\)` when `\(D\)` = .blue[0]
  
  - *Translate into words*: `\(Y_{Andrew}\)`(.pink[1])

&lt;br&gt;
--

- **Individual Treatment Effect (ITE)**:

  - `\(ITE\)` = `\(Y_{i}\)`(.pink[1]) - `\(Y_{i}\)`(.blue[0])

  - `\(ITE_{Andrew}\)` =  `\(Happiness_{Andrew}\)`(.pink[1]) `\(-\)` `\(Happiness_{Andrew}\)`(.blue[0])
  
---

### Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

- Only one potential outcome will ever be realized and observed

--

- But to estimate the ITE, we need the *unobserved* counterfactual outcome:

&lt;br&gt;


Respondent    |   `\(D_i\)` |   `\(Y_{i}\)`(.pink[1])   |   `\(Y_{i}\)`(.blue[0])
-             |   -     |   -                   |   -
Andrew        |   1     |   1                   |   .zomp[??]

&lt;br&gt;


- Here, `\(Y_{Andrew}\)`(.blue[0]) is missing

- We cannot calculate `\(ITE_{Andrew}\)` =  `\(Y_{Andrew}\)`(.pink[1]) `\(-\)` `\(Y_{Andrew}\)`(.blue[0])

---

### Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

- More generally, our schedule of potential outcomes is incomplete!

&lt;br&gt;

Respondent    |   `\(D_i\)` |   `\(Y_{i}\)`(.pink[1])   |   `\(Y_{i}\)`(.blue[0])   
-             |   -     |   -                   |   -
Andrew        | 1                   | 1                       | .zomp[??]
Barbara       | 1                   | 1                       | .zomp[??]
Charlotte     | 1                   | 1                       | .zomp[??]       
Denis         | 0                   | .zomp[??]               | 0       
Eric          | 0                   | .zomp[??]               | 1       
Fabian        | 0                   | .zomp[??]               | 0       

&lt;br&gt;

- So what can we do?

---

### From Individual to Average Treatment Effects (ATE)

- We **cannot** say anything about the effect of treatment for any individual...

- ...but we **can** make causal statements about the **average treatment effect** (ATE) for the population

&lt;br&gt;
--

- The `\(ATE\)` is the average of individual-level treatment effects `\(Y_{i}\)`(.pink[1]) `\(-\)` `\(Y_{i}\)`(.blue[0])

- Equivalently, the `\(ATE\)` = `\(\mu_{Y(1)} - \mu_{Y(0)}\)` where

  - `\(\mu_{Y(1)}\)` is the average value of `\(Y_{i}\)`(.pink[1]) for all subjects, and
  
  - `\(\mu_{Y(0)}\)` is the average value of `\(Y_{i}\)`(.blue[0]) for all subjects

&lt;br&gt;
--

- How can we estimate `\(\mu_{Y(1)}\)` and `\(\mu_{Y(0)}\)` given that we are missing some data?

---

- Suppose you wanted to find out the average height of students in Mannheim.

- Unfortunately, you don't have the time to track down every single student and measure how tall they are.

- What would you do?

---

### Relationship to Random Sampling

- In sampling, we want to know some population parameters (e.g. average height of MA students), but we do not have data on every single person.

- We draw a **random sample**, calculate the mean height in this sample, and use this as an estimate of the mean height in the student population.

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Here, we want to know the .pink[average happiness level if everyone were to eat ice cream] ( `\(\mu_{Y(1)}\)` ) and the .blue[average happiness level if no one were to eat ice cream] ( `\(\mu_{Y(0)}\)` ).

- How do we draw a random sample of potential outcomes?

---

### Experiments vs. Observational Studies

- In an experiment, the researcher **randomly assigns** people to either treatment or control

  - e.g. You toss a coin, and this decides whether or not Andrew gets to eat ice cream

&lt;br&gt;

- In an observational study, people can decide for themselves whether they want to eat ice cream

  - Individuals "self-select" into treatment or control
  
  - What's the problem here?
  
  
---

### Key Take-Away

&lt;!-- In experiments with **random assignment**, the credibility of causal claims is not based on whether the model includes the “right” controls (or has the “right” functional form). --&gt;

&lt;!-- Rather, evidence of causality rests on the **procedure** by which individuals / units are sorted into treatment and control groups. --&gt;

Under random assignment, we can take the average treatment outcomes *in our observed sample* as an **unbiased estimate** of the average of **all potential treatment outcomes.**

&lt;!-- Equivalently: `\(E[Y_i\)`(.blue[0]) `\(| D_i = 0]\)` as equivalent to `\(E[Y_i\)`(.blue[0]) `\(]\)` --&gt;

The same goes for the control outcomes.

The difference between these two averages is the ATE.

In other words, we estimate the ATE, we only need to compare average outcomes in the treatment and control groups.  

---

### An important implication of random assignment

Random assignment also implies that any (observed and unobserved) **omitted variables** that affect outcomes are (on average) equally likely to be present in the treatment and control groups. 

Thus the treatment itself is the only systematic driver of differences in outcomes.

**We do not need statistical controls**!

---

### A Concrete Example

- Suppose we are interested in the effect of **rainfall on election day** on **voter turnout**.  We have the following data:

City    |   Rain?   |   Turnout
-       |   -       |   -      
A       | 1         | 60%
B       | 1         | 55%
C       | 0         | 70%      
D       | 0         | 75%
E       | 1         | 65%
F       | 0         | 80%

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Is rainfall "randomly" assigned to cities?

- What is the ATE?

class: middle

**Discuss:** A researcher wants to know how winning large sums of money in a national lottery affects peoples views about inheritance taxes. 

The researcher interviews a random sample of adults and compares the attitudes of those who report winning more than $10,000 in the lottery to those who claim to have won little or nothing. The researcher reasons that the lottery chooses winners at random, and therefore the amount that people report having won is random.

Is this sound reasoning? In other words, are the potential outcomes of those who report winning more than $10,000 identical, in expectation, to those who report winning little or nothing?

---

### Assumptions

1. **Independence:** Potential outcomes respond solely to receipt of the treatment, not to the assignment itself or any indirect by-products of the assignment.

2. **Non-Interference:** Potential outcomes for each individual reflect only the treatment or control status of that individual and not the treatment or control status of other individuals. No matter which subjects the random assignment allocates to treatment or control, a given subject’s potential outcomes remain the same.

  - This idea is commonly termed the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA).


---

### Independence Example


Suppose you want to test the effectiveness of a new medication. You recruit a sample of people who are interested in the medication, and randomly divide them into treatment and control groups.

The treatment group is asked to take the medication in the form of a pill. The control group is told that their purpose is to serve as comparison group, and thus will not be receiving the medication.  

What's the problem here?

---
### Non-Interference Example

Suppose you are interested in the effectiveness of a new COVID vaccine.  You conduct your study in a retirement home (Seniorenresidenz).

90\% of residents are randomly selected to receive the vaccine, while the remaining 10% of residents receive a placebo.

To measure vaccine effectiveness, you compare infection rates between the two groups.

What's the problem here?

(Hint: what if only 10% of residents received the vaccine and 90% the placebo?)
