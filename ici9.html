### Warm-Up

Suppose you want to assess the impact of social insurance (welfare) on employment rates. 

Before 1989, welfare recipients in Quebec under age 30 received lower benefits (~185 per month) than recipients over age 30 (~507 per month). 

The employment rate all people (aged 18-29) receiving low benefits is around 0.67, whereas it is around 0.57 for all people (aged 30-65) receiving high benefits. 

Can we simply compare employment rates in these two groups to calculate the ATE?

### Introduction

The logic of a regression discontinuity design (RDD) consists of several core elements:

- Units of observation are scored on some rating variable

- Treatment is assigned to those units whose value of the score exceeds a known cutoff, and withheld from units whose value of the score is below the cutoff

- The probability of receiving the treatment thus changes abruptly at the known threshold 


---


### A Motivating Example and Some Notation

Imagine that high school students take a standardized test at age 17.

Students who answer &gt; 50% of the questions on this test receive a public commendation.

We want to know whether public commendations increase the motivation to apply to college in the next year.

- We have `\(n\)` units, indexed by `\(i\)` = 1, 2, ..., `\(n\)`

- Each unit has a score (or "running variable") `\(X_i\)`

- `\(x_0\)` is a known cutoff

- Units with `\(X_i &gt; x_0\)` are assigned to the treatment condition, and units with `\(X_i &lt; x_0\)` are assigned to control.

- Potential outcomes:
$$
Y_i =
`\begin{cases}
    Y_i(1)  &amp; \text{if} \;  X_i &gt; x_0 \\
    Y_i(0)  &amp; \text{if} \;  X_i &lt; x_0
\end{cases}`
$$

### Graphical Inspection

### Graphical Inspection

In case the outcome data are noisy (or dichotomous), you can use bins:

.center[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/reardon_outcomescatter2.png" width="900px" /&gt;
]

--

You should also inspect your **pre-treatment covariates** to make sure that they are **not** discontinous at the threshold.

---

### A quick exercise

In some US states, anti-discrimination laws are enforced only for companies with 15 or more employees.

Consider a RDD design that studies the effects of these laws on minority hiring by comparing firms with 13 or 14 employees against firms with 15 or 16 employees.

Do you think that "treatment" (i.e. being subject to the law) is "as-if" randomly assigned within this set of firms?

How would you to check the plausibility of this assumption?

---

### Check for (self-)sorting around the cutoff

We should observe similar density on either side of the cutoff.

### RD in 2 Dimensions

.pull-left[

- Rather than a single test:
  
  - math test, and
  
  - language test
  
  
- You need to score above a 50 on both tests to receive the commendation

]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/icigraphics/rd2d.png" width="900px" /&gt;

---

### Geographic RD

.pull-left[

- Policies and laws (and mass media) often change at geographic boundaries

- Example: Children Health Insurance Program (CHIP)

- Wisconsin introduced co-payments, while Illinois did not

- What's the effect on doctor visits?

- Use lat-long coordinates to define the cutoff

### Two Estimation Approaches

&lt;br&gt;

1. RD as extrapolation

2. RD as a local experiment




---

### RDD as Extrapolation

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/rddtx.png" width="475px" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

&lt;br&gt;

- Assumes that `\(E[Y_1 | X]\)` and `\(E[Y_0 | X]\)` are continuous functions at the cutoff

- If we extrapolate these lines to the cutoff itself, we can estimate both `\(\alpha_1\)` and `\(\alpha_0\)`

- Note that the effect is extremely local!

]


---

### Parametric Estimation 

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/elsner1.png" width="475px" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

Linear model:
$$
y = \alpha + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 D + \beta_3 X \times D + \epsilon
$$
where: 

- `\(X\)` is rating variable, centered at cutoff `\(x_0\)`

- `\(D\)` is a dummy for `\(X &gt; x_0\)`

The interaction allows different slopes on different sides of the cutoff.

We can also estimate quadratic (and higher order) polynomials.

]

---

### The Importance of Functional Form

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/elsner2.png" width="475px" /&gt;

The "true" effect is 0, but RD gives the wrong answer!

]

--

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/elsner3.png" width="475px" /&gt;

Linear vs. quadratic fits provide different answers!

]

--


We don't know the "true" functional form

Global polynomial fits are influenced by data far away from the cutoff



---
### Nonparametric Estimation

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

- Selecting smaller bandwidths closer to the cutoff provides better (linear) fits of the underlying data


]


.pull-right[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/rddbw.png" width="500px" /&gt;
]

---
### Nonparametric Estimation

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

- Selecting smaller bandwidths closer to the cutoff provides better (linear) fits of the underlying data

- You can also weight observations within the bandwidth.

]


.pull-right[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/rdkernels.png" width="600px" /&gt;
]


---
### Nonparametric Estimation

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

- Selecting smaller bandwidths closer to the cutoff provides better (linear) fits of the underlying data

- You can also weight observations within the bandwidth.

- BUT: bias-efficiency tradeoff!

- Statistical software ( rdrobust ) will select a bandwidth to optimize this tradeoff.

]


.pull-right[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/rddbw.png" width="500px" /&gt;
]






---

### Cross-Validation Approaches

.fnsize[
- Pick a proportion `\(p\)` of data on either side of the cutoff to use for **validation**.

- Start with the first observation to the left of the cutoff. We can observe the **outcome** for this observation.  

- Using a given functional form, kernal weight and bandwidth, see how well we can predict this outcome (using a regression model).

- Calculate the prediction error.

- Repeat for all observations in the validation dataset (on both sides of the continuity).

- Compute the mean squared error (MSE).

- Repeat for other bandwidths.

- Choose the bandwidth which minimizes the MSE (assuming a given kernal weight and functional form), and use this to estimate `\(\hat{\tau}^{RD}\)`.

- Ideally, you will obtain the roughly the same estimate of `\(\hat{\tau}^{RD}\)` across all of your analytical choices.
]

---

### Summary

RD estimation requires a lot of choices:

- functional form

- kernal weight

- bandwidth

&lt;br&gt;

You should plot your data to illustrate the appropriateness of your choices.

But also lots of robustness checks to show roughly similar results across all analytical choices.



---

### RD as a Local Experiment

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/rddexp.png" width="500px" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

- Take a window `\(W_o = [x_0 - w_0, x_0 + w_0]\)`

  - All units within this window whose scores are below the cutoff are comparable to units whose scores are above it.

  - Treatments assigned in `\(W_0\)` are independent of potential outcomes.

- Better approach if:

  - Running variable is discrete
  
  - There are relatively few observations near the cutoff (since we do not rely upon extrapolation)

]

---

### Selecting the Window

.pull-left[

- In most RD applications, the window where a local randomization assumption is plausible will be unknown.

- Window selection implies a precision-bias tradeoff

- One idea: choose a window such that covariate balance (and the score) holds in that window and all windows contained in it.

- You should also test the robustness of the result to alternative `\(W_0\)`s.
