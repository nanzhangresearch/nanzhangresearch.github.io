### Summing Up So Far

**Today:**

- Exposure to immigrants **causes** an increase in exclusionary attitudes (Enos)

  - Although some groups are more disliked than others (Hainmueller et al.)

- Interethnic contact may **not** reduce prejudice (Elwert)

- What are the consequences of immigration-related diversity for partisanship?


--

&lt;br&gt;

**Next week:**

- What are the consequences of immigration-related diversity for the welfare state?

  - Ethnic diversity (or, more precisely, the presence of ethnic minorities) seems to be associated with reduced social cohesion (Putnam)

### Why Partisanship?

"Partisanship influences just about every other political attitude Americans hold"

### Where does partisanship come from?  A sports analogy...

&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/pedgraphics/football.jpg" width="700px" /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- How did you become a fan of your team?

- Would you ever stop being a fan / switch your allegiance to another team?

### The Michigan Model 

.center[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/pedgraphics/michigan_model.png" width="800px" /&gt;
]


- Note: party id is not the same as vote choice!


---

### The Michigan Model 

*Social identification involves comparing a judgment about oneself with one’s perception of a social group. As people reflect on whether they are Democrats or Republicans (or neither), they call to mind some mental image, or stereotype, of what these sorts of people are like and square these images with their own self-conceptions. In effect, people ask themselves two questions:*

- *What kinds of social groups come to mind as I think about Democrats, Republicans, and Independents?*

- *Which assemblage of groups (if any) best describes me?*

### A+H's Model

Party id closer to a "running tally" of evaluations of the parties’ competence and ideological appeal

Partisan attachments are shaped by whether parties cater to voters' immigration preferences

**Demand side:**

- Undocumented immigrants put "unfair burden" on schools, health care and public services

- Immigrants depress wages

- Immigrants do not learn English quickly enough

- Latinos add to the crime problem

### Panel Data 

Maybe party id `\(\rightarrow\)` attitudes, rather than the other way around?

So look at party switching:

A 1 s.d. shift in views of undocumented immigrants `\(\rightarrow\)` 0.25 point shift on the 7-point party id scale.

### Sorting on Racial Attitudes

.pull-left[
.fnsize[

&lt;br&gt;

(1) Irish, Italian, and Jewish ethnicities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors.

(2) Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class.

(3) Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve.

(4) It's really a matter of some people just not trying hard enough: if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.

### The Social Bases of Partisan Support

"When the social groups associated with each party change, mass shifts in partisanship can and have happened."

"A [Democratic] party that was supported by lower-class white interests increasingly became a party supported by the black community, and since the 1980s has increasingly become a party supported by Latinos and other immigrants. **In other words, what it means to be a Democrat has changed.**

"With a clear majority of the white population now on the Republican side and a clear majority of the minority population now on the Democratic one, political conflict in the United States is increasingly likely to be synonymous with racial conflict"

--

&lt;br&gt;

Self-enforcing dynamics:

- Parties adopt more polarized positions on race and immigration

- Stronger stereotypes about "what types of people" are Dems and Reps

---

### Summing Up

&lt;br&gt;

- Party id is a social identity which shapes the way we interact with politics

- Large-scale changes in party attachments can and do change over time (Michigan School)

- In the US case, partisan sorting on racial attitudes has been occurring **over decades**

- Immigration and Trump may only have accelerated these underlying trends...

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Is there a different story in Europe / Germany?

### Can Mainstream Parties Win Back Their Voters?


&lt;br&gt;

- *Frustrated issue publics* - support the AfD because no other party adopts their preferences on immigration

  - AFD support only "skin deep"

  - voters would "switch back" if other parties hardened their line on immigration

&lt;br&gt;

- *Anti-establishment voters* - general distrust of political institutions and established parties

  - support the AfD no matter what, not swayed by policy shifts from other parties
  
  - prefer "the original" over the "copy"

.center[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/pedgraphics/chou_fig9.png" width="550px" /&gt;
]


*"For every voter that you win back with AfD-light-slogans, you lose two in the middle."*

---

### Comparisons to the US case

&lt;br&gt;

- Different outcomes: **partisanship** (US literature) vs. **vote choice** (EU literature)

&lt;br&gt;

- Is AfD membership a new social identity?

  - Note: some people don't switch even if other parties adopt a tougher line on immigration

- What "sorts of people" are AfD supporters?  

  - And what stereotypes are associated with the other parties?

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Is the sorting process ongoing?  

- Where are the remaining unsorted voters?


&lt;!-- - "Unfinished" partisan sorting? --&gt;

&lt;!--   - Rise of the RR has been a feature in (most) European countries only since the 1990s (and in Germany, only since 2013) --&gt;

&lt;!--   - GOP is a broadbased party, whereas AFD focuses almost exclusively on immigration `\(\rightarrow\)` faster sorting? --&gt;


&lt;!-- -- --&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;br&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Open Questions: --&gt;

&lt;!--   - Are the correlations between immigration attitudes and AfD party id strengthening over time? --&gt;

&lt;!--   - Where are the remaining unsorted voters? --&gt;
