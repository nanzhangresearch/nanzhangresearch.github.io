### Introduction

&lt;br&gt;

- **This week**: prejudice and discrimination against Muslims

- Next week: Muslims' political incorporation

### Identifying a Muslim Penalty

.pull-left[

Problem:

- Muslim-majority countries are located outside of Christian-heritage regions

- Is discrimination due to **religion**, region of origin, ethnicity, SES?

- Example: comparing discrimination against Muslim vs. Christian immigrants is like comparing discrimination against Turks vs. Poles.  

- Does this identify an anti-Muslim effect?

]

--

.pull-right[

Solution (Adida et al. 2010):

- Study two ethnic groups (Joolas and Serers) from Western Senegal living in France

- Both groups contain both Christians and Muslims

- Both groups are similar in terms of SES in Senegal and at time of arrival

### What Is Islamophobia?

&lt;!-- - Muslim immigrants are not **necessarily** resented more than Christian immigrants. It depends on their religious behavior. --&gt;

### What Is Islamophobia?

&lt;!-- - Holding constant religious practice, liberals don’t really discriminate based on either ethnic origin or nominal faith. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - In other words, liberals mostly care about religiosity. --&gt;

### Questions

- The reading is framed mainly in terms of value conflits.

- But what images come to mind when someone is called "radical" or "fundamentalist"?

--

&lt;br&gt;

- How might the perception of Muslims have changed since 2015?

--

&lt;br&gt;

- What can be done to counteract negative stereotypes?

### Field Experimental Evidence (Choi et al. 2021)

.pull-left[

Data collection: 

- 26 train stations in NRW, Nieder-Sachsen, and Sachsen in summer 2019

- 1.830 interventions measuring whether a Muslim vs. non-Muslim confederate is "helped"

- Difference in helping rates = discrimination

- Treatment: signalling **gender attitudes**

### What Can Be Done?

&lt;br&gt;

- **Assimilationism**:  integration is best achieved through compulsory assimilation policies.

  - Immigrants need to be compelled to adhere to the common set of values and norms idealized by the predominant culture of the native majority.

&lt;br&gt;

- **Multiculturalism**: rejects notions of cultural incompatibility; instead, cultural pluralism based on the coexistence of different cultures and values

  - successful integration of immigrants is best realized if governments celebrate the cultural diversity that is entailed by recent immigration and acknowledge the cultures of minority groups as having equal value to the mainstream culture

### Enforced Assimilation: Veiling Bans

.center[

---

### The French Headscarf Ban

- In 2004, Parliament passed a bill to ban "conspicuous religious symbols" in schools

- Girls wearing headscarves were first removed from classes to "negotiate" alternatives to veiling

- If no resolution: 

  - leave the public education system (if aged 16+)
  
  - switch to private school
  
  - pursue distance learning
  
  - leave the country
  
- After law's passage, only 639 "violators" out of 10 million students

---

### Effects of the Headscarf Ban (Abdelgadir and Fouka 2020)

- Control group: girls born in 1985 or earlier (aged 19+ at the time of the ban)

- Treatment group: girls born after 1985

### Effects on Identity

.pull-left[

Discrimination may:

- encourage assimilation

- provoke "reactive ethnicity"

&lt;br&gt;

Identification problem:  

`\(veiling \rightarrow perceived \;discrim. \rightarrow identity\)`

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/pedgraphics/abdelgadir_fig3.png" width="800px" /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Women appeared to reject the choice between identities and reasserted their right to be both French and Muslim.

---

### From Laicité to State Support

- France is a prototypical case of separation of church and state

- Maybe an especially hard case when it comes to religious accommodation?`

&lt;br&gt;

- In contrast, state support for Christianity is widespread in Western Europe:

  - Public identification with religious symbols and traditional customs
  
  - Religious education in public schools
  
  - Church taxes and financial subsidies for recognized religious organizations

- Here, a multicultural approach might advocate for treating all religions on equal footing


---

### Challenges to Accommodation (Helbling+Traunmueller 2016)

Accommodating religious minorities = reducing favoritism towards Christianity

  - Offering halal options in public school lunches (or not serving pork altogether)
  
  - Removing Christian symbols from public buildings
  
  - Rededicating religious holidays, or adding new Muslim public holidays

### State Support for Religion Index


.fnsize[

Index includes:

- Religious education is present in public schools

- Religious taxers

- Salaried clergy

- Funding for religious schools and educational programs

- Restrictions on activities during religious holidays 

- The presence of religious symbols on the canton’s flag

- Direct general grants to religious foundations

### Political Possibilities 

We have seen that conservatives dislike (religious) Muslims because they are Muslims. However, liberals do not dislike Muslims *per se*. 

Rather they dislike the radical elements of (Muslim) religious practice.

How can we use this insight to reduce Islamophobia?

--

&lt;br&gt;

To gain electoral support for religious accommodation, liberals must balance:

- (1) their commitment to values of gender equality, free speech, etc. 

- (2) respect for minority rights.


&lt;br&gt;

The key is to transform "zero sum games" into "positive sum games"

### Public Rally Experiment (Ivarsflaten and Sniderman 2022)

- preach Islamic values
- explain conservative ideas about women
- preach conservative ideas about women

### Handshake Experiment (Helbling et al. 2023)

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

*For a non-Muslim, to refuse to shake hands with a member of the opposite sex, is not simply to fail to show respect: it is to treat them with disrespect. It is plainly unacceptable.*

*For some religious Muslims, to shake hands with members of the opposite sex is precisely not to show respect: it is, instead, to treat them with disrespect. It is plainly unacceptable.*

### Handshake Experiment

.pull-left[

Some local politicians were invited by the local Muslim community center to the annual spring festival. To welcome them, the local politicians shook hands with the hosts. Some imams did not shake hands with the female politicians. [**Instead, they put their hand on their heart in greeting**]. After the meeting, some complained that Muslims do not follow the customs of our country. They asked that next time everyone present be asked to shake hands.

]


.pull-right[

The local school organized a welcome day for newly arrived families with school children. Among them were also some Muslim families. To welcome them, the teachers shook hands with the families. Some of the Muslim children did not shake hands with the female teachers. [**Instead, they put their hand on their heart in greeting**]. After the meeting, some complained that Muslims do not follow the customs of our country. They asked that next time everyone present be asked to shake hands.
