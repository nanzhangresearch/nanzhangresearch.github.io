### Warm-Up

Suppose you want to assess the impact of social insurance (welfare) on employment rates. 

Before 1989, welfare recipients in Quebec under age 30 received lower benefits (~185 per month) than recipients over age 30 (~507 per month). 

1. Please name the different types of variables that you need to conduct a (sharp) RDD analysis and indicate what these variables correspond to in the example.

2. The employment rate people receiving low benefits (~185 per month) is around 0.67, whereas it is around 0.57 for people receiving high benefits (~507 per month). 

  - Why donâ€™t we simply compare employment rates in these two groups to calculate the ATE?

3. A rumor is going around: Some people say that whites more often end up with high benefits, while minorities more often end up with low benefits. 

  - If this rumor was true, would this be problematic, and why (not)? 
  
  - How can we test whether there is a problem? 

---
### Introduction

- Unexpected events (terrorist attacks, political scandals, natural disasters) can take place during survey fieldwork

- Afford opportunities to identify the causal effect of these events on public opinion.

- Compare individuals interviewed before ($t_i &lt; t_e$) and after ($t_i &gt; t_e$) the event.

- Assumes that **interview date** and the **timing of the event** are independent

  - "As-if" random assignment into treatment and control

---
### Relationship to RDD

- The running variable `\(X_i\)` is captured in fieldwork days when interviews took place

- The cutoff `\(x_0\)` denotes the moment when the event occurred

- But treatment assignment is not linked to the cutoff in any predetermined or known way

- Also not clear that the rating variable (time of interview) should be substantively related to the potential outcomes

  - Less stringent reliance on narrow bandwidths
  
---
### Excludability Assumption


The timing of the interview `\(t\)` should affect the outcome `\(Y\)` only through the event `\(T\)` 

--

Potential problems:

- **Collateral events**: `\(T\)` = terrorist attack, but responses are also likely to be affected by media coverage
  
  - Could define `\(T\)` as **compound treatment** 
    
    - But which parts of the treatment bundle are "doing the work?"
      
    - And would we observe the same outcomes had the collateral events not occurred?

--

- **Unrelated Time Trends**: e.g. `\(Y\)` = happiness, which could be correlated with `\(t\)` due to seasonal patterns

--

- **Endogenous Timing of the Event:** e.g. opposition politicians might scandalous information about the government only at the "right moment"


---

### Ignorability Assumption

Potential outcomes should be independent of treatment assignment.

--

- **Fieldwork Organization:** 

  - Respondents in area A are interviewed first, then interviewers move to area B, etc.
  
      - Areas could be correlated with both `\(t\)` and `\(Y_i\)`

  - Quota sampling: fieldworkers try to achieve demographic "representativeness", and incomplete quotas are filled at the end of the fieldwork phase.
  
      - `\(t\)`  may be correlated with respondents' observable characteristics
    
--

- **Reachability and Attrition:** 

  - People may choose when (and if) to participate in the survey (especially in online surveys)
  
  - The event may make people more or less likely to respond (or say "don't know")

      - `\(t\)` may be correlated with respondents' *unobservable* characteristics
  

---
### Bandwidth / Window Selection

- In RDDs, the running variable `\(X_i\)` is almost always correlated with potential outcomes `\(Y_i\)`

- This may or may not be true in UESD

- Narrow bandwidths can reduce the influence of time trends, collateral events or confounders correlated with `\(t\)`

- But when the assumptions hold, a narrow bandwidth has **disadvantages**:

  - Reduced precision, without reducing bias
  
  - The effects of certain types of events can take some time to unfold
  
      -  Narrow bandwidth can lead to false negatives!


---
### Discuss

How well do these assumptions hold in [Frey 2022?](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/101/2/943/6460866)?

What does Frey do to check their plausibility?

What else could he have done?

---

### A Checklist for UESD Designs

- Qualitative assessments: 

  - Was the timing of the event **unexpected** and **exogenous (i.e. not manipulated)**? 
  
  - What else was going on at the same time?
  
  - For how long was the event salient (e.g. in news coverage)?
  
  - How was the survey rolled out?  Was multistage sampling and/or quota sampling used?  
  
      - In the case of particularly disruptive events: any changes in the fieldwork organization?
      
  - What were the procedures for recontacting individuals? 
  
  - How much discretion did individuals have about when they would take the survey?

---

### A Checklist for UESD Designs

- Quantitative assessments: 

  - Balance tests on pre-treatment covariates, as well as "structural" survey variables:
  
      - e.g. interest during the interview, number of times contacted, region of residence, frequency of "don't knows"
  
  - Robustness to estimation techniques (RDD vs. difference in means) and models with and without controls (and entropy balancing)
  
  - Robustness to different bandwidths
  
  - No significant placebo effects in the control group, and outcome is temporally stable in the control group
  
  - No significant placebo effects in same dates in other years
  
  - Falsification tests on other outcome variables

---

### Other Issues

- **Non-compliance:** subjects interviewed after the event may not have paid any attention to it

  - See if other other survey items could serve as manipulation checks?
  
--

&lt;br&gt;

- **Treatment heterogeneity / subgroup analysis**: make sure that you don't create subgroups based on post-treatment variables. e.g.:

  - Event = political scandal
  
  - Y = trust in government
  
  - Moderator = party id
  
---

### Next Week

- Suppose we want to study the effect of some event or policy that occurs at `\(t=1\)`

- We compare outcomes at `\(t=1\)` vs outcomes at `\(t=0\)`, but we are worried that other things could also have changed at the same time.

- In this case, we find a counterfactual unit which did not experience the event or policy, and look at how its outcomes changed over time.

- We then compare the **difference-in-differences.**

- Please read [Flores 2017](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/692983).

- We will also discuss what to do when we cannot find a good counterfactual unit.
