# 10. Unexpected Events During Surveys
]
.date[
### 9 November 2023
]

---







### Introduction

- Unexpected events (terrorist attacks, political scandals, natural disasters) can take place during survey fieldwork

- Large-scale representative surveys often provide dates of interview

  - ESS, "-barometers", SOEP, Allbus

- Compare individuals interviewed before `\((t_i &lt; t_e)\)` and after `\((t_i &gt; t_e)\)` the event to identify **causal effect** on public opinion

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Extensions to "always on" data sources such as Twitter or Youtube comments

  - Importantly: people self-select into T vs. C
  
  - Still, some interesting applications (e.g. [Flores](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/692983) )

### Discuss with your neighbor:

- To what extend does UESD resemble an RDD?  And how is it different?

- Consider:

  - Is the rating variable (time) substantively related to potential outcomes?
  
  - Does the RD-as-extrapolation approach make sense?
  
  - What approach does Legewie use?

### Legewie Country-Level Results

.pull-left[

- Model:

$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta \, T_i + \theta X_i + \epsilon
$$
- `\(T\)` = 1 if interviewed 1 week after the Bali attack

- `\(T\)` = 0 if interviewed 1 month before the attack

- Model is estimated separately for each country

### Longer-Term Results

---

### Why T and Y might be correlated

- Is there a strong underlying time trend (or seasonality)?

  - Bias is worse with larger time windows, or as windows are "shifted out"
  
--

&lt;br&gt;

- Solutions:
  
  - Check for trends in the control group
  
  - Falsfication checks in other survey years

---

### Fictitious Event Simulation


.pull-left[

- If potential outcomes are correlated with time, we should see significant effects at "fictitious" cutoff points

- Choose random cutoff days from the ESS fieldwork period and estimate the same model

- Restrictions:

  - `\(\geq 20\)` respondents in both treatment and control groups in the country

  - `\(\geq 3\)` countries

- Graph the **proportion of countries** with significant results (or effects as large as Finland)

---

### Why T and Y might be correlated

- Quota sampling: certain types of people are easier to contact

--

- Solutions:

  - Check for covariate balance, and number of attempted contacts
  
  - Good to know what the quotas are
  
--

&lt;br&gt;

- "Reachability": people can choose when they want to answer the survey 

- Selective attrition / participation on certain questions

--

- Solutions:

  - Check pattern of "Don't Knows"



---

### Why T and Y might be correlated

- Stratified survey administration

--

- Solutions:

  - Check for balance on urban / rural
  
  - Just control for strata fixed effects (if you know how the survey was administered)


--

&lt;br&gt;

- The event is not truly random

  - e.g. timing of corruption scandals is probably endogenous
  
--

- Solutions:

  - Qualitative knowledge

---

### Consequences for Bandwidth / Window Selection

- In RDDs, the running variable `\(X_i\)` is almost always correlated with potential outcomes `\(Y_i\)`

- This may or may not be true in UESD

- Narrow bandwidths can reduce the influence of time trends, **collateral events** or confounders correlated with `\(t\)`

- But when the assumptions hold, a narrow bandwidth has **disadvantages**:

  - Reduced precision, without reducing bias
  
  - The effects of certain types of events can take some time to unfold
  
      -  Narrow bandwidth can lead to false negatives!


---

### Additional Complications
  
- Effect of the event is almost certainly shaped by the quantity **and tone** of media coverage

  - You will likely need media content analysis to "describe the treatment" in full
  
  - Can also help to rule out collateral events

  - But complicated when people can "choose their own news"

--

&lt;br&gt;

- **Treatment heterogeneity / subgroup analysis**: make sure that you don't create subgroups based on post-treatment variables. e.g.:

  - Event = political scandal
  
  - Y = trust in government
  
  - Moderator = party id

---

### A Checklist for UESD Designs

- Qualitative assessments: 

  - Was the timing of the event **unexpected** and **exogenous (i.e. not manipulated)**? 
  
  - What else was going on at the same time?
  
  - For how long was the event salient (e.g. in news coverage)?
  
  - How was the survey rolled out?  Was multistage sampling and/or quota sampling used?  
  
      - In the case of particularly disruptive events: any changes in the fieldwork organization?
      
  - What were the procedures for recontacting individuals? 
  
  - How much discretion did individuals have about when they would take the survey?

---

### A Checklist for UESD Designs

- Quantitative assessments: 

  - Balance tests on pre-treatment covariates, as well as "structural" survey variables:
  
      - e.g. interest during the interview, number of times contacted, region of residence, frequency of "don't knows"
  
  - Robustness to estimation techniques (RDD vs. difference in means) and models with and without controls
  
  - Robustness to different bandwidths
  
  - No significant placebo effects in the control group, and outcome is temporally stable in the control group
  
  - No significant placebo effects in same dates in other years
  
  - Falsification tests on other outcome variables (to help nail down mechanisms)

### Preview: DiD

**Idea:** deal with potential time trends by comparing **changes** in outcomes for T vs. C units

--

.pull-left[

Suppose we are interested in the employment effects of raising the minimum wage in NJ:


&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/rdgraphics/njdid.png" width="600px" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- Find another state (here: Pennysylvania) that experienced the same employment trends, but which did not enact the minimum wage

- Changes in employment in Penn serve as a counterfactual for what would have happened in NJ had the minimum wage law not been passed

  - **parallel trends** assumption

- Compare the **difference-in-differences** to estimate the causal effect of the law.

### Was Pennslyvania a Good Counterfactual?

We can only **assume** parallel trends but looking at trends in the pre-treatment period might help us to gauge its validity:

]

---

### Preview: Matching

- So far, we have invoked randomization to try to estimate unobserved counterfactuals

- Matching (and DiD) instead tries to approximate the counterfactual:

  - Find C units that are similar to T units on observed characteristics X
  
- **Idea**: for units with similar values of X, treatment status is "as if" random

  - But sometimes it's unclear why this assumption is warranted.


---

### Putting it together: Panel Matching

- I will talk about matching in much more detail.

  - As with RDD, there are lots of analytical choices to make

- New applied design: matching combined with DiD in panel data

- Please read [Ben-Menachem and Morris.](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055422001265) "Ticketing and Turnout: The Participatory Consequences of Low-Level Police Contact." *APSR* 2023.
