# 9. Muslim Political Incorporation
]
.date[
### 2 November 2023
]

### Introduction

.pull-left[

- Immigrants from Muslim-majority countries comprise growing shares of **voters**

- Under what circumstances will political parties include Muslims in their slate of candidates?

- How will efforts to reach out to Muslim voters impact parties' ideological cohesiveness and long-run electoral performance?

]

]


---

### Why Political Incorporation Is Important

- Signal of "ideological and sociological identities of the party"

  - What does a Green / SPD / CDU party member "look like"?
  
  - How much does this person resemble me?

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Elected representatives who share descriptive traits with voters may be more willing and able to represent these voters:

  - navigating bureaucracies (housing, naturalization, employment)
  
  - religious accomodations (building mosques, halal foods in schools)

---

### Building Blocks of a Model

&lt;br&gt;


- Voter types: .red[ethnocentrists], .blue[cosmopolitans], and .yellow_orange[Muslim minorities]

--

.pull-left[

- Value conflicts:

  - .red[ethnocentrists] vs .yellow_orange[minorities]
  
  - .blue[cosmopolitans] vs .yellow_orange[minorities]

]

--

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/pedgraphics/dancygier_32.png" width="600px" /&gt;
]

---

### Minority Concentration

*Traditionally minded and pious [Muslims] are more likely to concentrate in urban areas than are less observant co-religionists.*

Reasons:

- Housing discrimination

--

- Mosques, halal foods, religious schools are much more easily provided in dense enclaves.

--

- Tight social linkages help to sustain religious customs:

  - *The small geographic scale of urban neighborhoods facilitates the monitoring of behavior. Norm transgressions, such as failure to wear traditional dress or religious symbols, or contact with the opposite sex, are more easily observed in small, densely populated urban areas.*

--

&lt;br&gt;

Social structures and community networks within the enclave can **efficiently mobilize voters**

- especially since unions and church attendance have become less important

---

### Inclusion Strategies


- **Symbolic Inclusion**

  - Appeals primarily to ....
  
  - Occurs where the share of Muslim voters is...


---

### Inclusion Strategies


- **Symbolic Inclusion**

  - Appeals primarily to .blue[cosmopolitans]
  
  - Occurs where the share of Muslim voters is **not pivotal**


---

### Symbolic Candidates

&lt;br&gt;

Symbolic candidates should not alienate core constituencies or stray too far from party orthodoxy

.pull-left[

Center-left:

- candidates should be **socially liberal**

]


.pull-right[

Center-right:

- candidateâ€™s Muslim roots will not come into conflict with **traditional Christian values**

]

--

&lt;br&gt;

But symbolic candidates may not be perceived as "authentic", with little appeal in areas of high .yellow_orange[minority concentration] 


---

### Inclusion Strategies


- **Symbolic Inclusion**

  - Appeals primarily to .blue[cosmopolitans]
  
  - Occurs where the share of Muslim voters is **not pivotal**


&lt;br&gt;

- **Vote-based Inclusion**

  - Appeals primarily to ....
  
  - Occurs where the share of Muslim voters is...
  
  
---

### Inclusion Strategies


- **Symbolic Inclusion**

  - Appeals primarily to .blue[cosmopolitans]
  
  - Occurs where the share of Muslim voters is **not pivotal**


&lt;br&gt;

- **Vote-based Inclusion**

  - Appeals primarily to (traditionally-minded) .yellow_orange[minorities]
  
  - Occurs where the share of Muslim voters is **sizable** and can offset losses from .blue[cosmopolitans] and .red[ethnocentrists]

---

### Authentic Candidates

- Candidates' preferences should reflect the **traditional religious values** and **social conservatism** of the .yellow_orange[minority enclave]

- Candidates should have **personalistic / kinship-based connections** and be embedded in **community networks:**

  - *[Kinship-based] politicking is important in Pakistani community politics. Substantive, policy-related issues were not typically discussed on canvassing campaigns by the main parties*
  
  - *What appears to have been of utmost importance was the chain of familial or social networks...which house doors were knocked on and by whom depended on which candidate/campaigner had links to or knowledge of the residents. Furthermore, if candidates encountered women or young people, they were told to tell their husbands and fathers...that such-and-such a candidate from such-and-such a region in Pakistan had called by...*


--

&lt;br&gt;

- Authentic candidates are also more likely to be **male**


---

### Preference Votes as a Measure of Personalistic Voting

### Putting it all together 

- Parties will put forward Muslim candidates when there are electoral incentives to do so

  - Symbolic inclusion to win over .blue[cosmopolitans]
   
  - Vote-based inclusion in .yellow_orange[minority enclaves] where Muslim voters are pivotal

--

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[
- "Pivotalness" depends on:

  - Size of the minority population
  
  - Citizenship regimes
  
  - Voting rights for non-citizens
  
  - Importance of preference votes
  
  - Size of electoral districts

---

### Inclusion Dilemmas

- Vote-based inclusion will feature candidates rooted in traditional community structures who are more **socially culturally conservative** than the average non-Muslim voter.

- This creates an "uneasy fit" with the core constituencies among both the center-left and the center-right.

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Vote-based inclusion `\(\Rightarrow\)` "personalistic" brand of politics

- Long-term implications for:

  - ideological attachment
  
  - the party "brand"


---

### Cross-National Evidence

.pull-left[

- UK and Belgium: voting rights for non-citizens and (in the UK) small electoral districts

- Germany and Austria: restrictive voting regimes, and at-large voting

]

--

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/pedgraphics/dancygier_44.png" width="600px" /&gt;

]

- "Parity ratio" = `\(\frac{\% \; Muslim \; Councilors \;  in \; Party}{\% \; Muslim \; Residents \; in \; Municipality}\)`

--

&lt;br&gt;

- Party ideology matters...but electoral incentives seem to matter more!

---

### Even Right Parties Nominate Muslims When It Pays

### Concentration / Deprivation Tradeoffs

- Ethnic enclaves also tend to be poorer:

.center[
&lt;img src="https://nanzhangresearch.github.io/pedgraphics/dancygier_t51.png" width="800px" /&gt;
]

- Poorer natives also tend to be more .red[ethnocentric]

- Parties must balance losses amongst .red[ethnocentrists] against gains from .yellow_orange[minority voters]

### Consequences of Vote-Based Inclusion

- *Seduced by the quick and effective delivery of ethnoreligious bloc votes, the Left misses its opportunity to build cross-ethnic, class-based coalitions...*

- *In vote-rich Muslim enclaves where Muslims are both poor and pious, class cleavages are replaced by ethnic and kinship cleavages; economic concerns are no longer tied to partisan attachments;*

- *Left parties ultimately end up losing seats they should have captured: The ethnic vote they have cultivated is not tied to partisan labels*

### Consequences of Vote-Based Inclusion

- *Muslim candidates who can rally the co-ethnic vote are plugged into ethnoreligious networks, connected to religious institutions, and enjoy high social standing within their communities. **Such candidates are almost always men.***

--

- Vote-based candidates may also strengthen negative stereotypes about Muslims

---

### Speculative Outlook:

- Since the key problem is the lack of "ideological fit" between enclave voters and the mainstream left, inclusion dilemmas should dissipate give enough time for values to converge..


--

- To the extent that parties understand the threats to their "brand", central party leaders may push for greater symbolic (rather than vote-based) inclusion.

  - *By writing off a few individual districts, strong party organizations would protect the collective good.*

--

- A revival of labor unions as a mobilization tool?

  - Unlike ethnoreligious organizations, unions deliver both votes and **ideological fit**

--

- A splintering of party systems?
  
  - *New sets of parties may emerge in which ethnocentrists, cosmopolitans, and minorities can each feel at home.*
