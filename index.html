    <div class="collapse" id="litfrance">Modern states are distinguished by the breadth and depth of public regulation over private affairs. This aspect of state capacity and state power is predicated on frequent and dense encounters between the state and the population it seeks to control. We argue that literacy in the language of state administration facilitates state–society interaction by lowering the transaction costs of those encounters. We support this claim with evidence drawing upon detailed historical data from nineteenth‐century France during a crucial period of state and nation building. Focusing on the specific domain of French marriage regulations, we find that increasing literacy predicts greater popular involvement with local authorities across French regions over time. These results demonstrate that literacy plays an important role in political development not solely by enhancing loyalty to the state, as the literature has recognized, but also by lowering linguistic and human capital barriers to state–society interaction.<br><hr>

    <div class="collapse" id="esrzurich">Recent waves of immigration have changed the demographic face of European societies and fueled considerable debate over the consequences of ethnic diversity for social cohesion. One prominent argument in this debate holds that individuals are less willing to extend trust and solidarity across ethnic lines, leading to lower social capital in multiethnic communities. We present a direct test of this proposition in a field experiment involving native-immigrant interactions in Zurich's Central Train Station. Our intervention consists of approaching commuters with a small request for assistance (borrowing a mobile phone), which we take as a measure of prosociality. We further differentiate between reactions towards natives as well as both high- and low-status immigrant groups. Compared to native-native interactions, we find lower solidarity in native-immigrant encounters, especially in cases involving stereotypically low-status immigrants. In exploratory analyses, we further show that discrimination only obtains in 'low cost' situations where commuters could easily justify not helping (e.g. by claiming not to carry a phone). Overall our results shed light on key theoretical mechanisms underlying patterns of solidarity in contemporary multiethnic societies.<br><hr>

    <div class="collapse" id="pnaslitter">How does ethnic diversity influence the maintenance of social norms in complex, Western societies? We provide evidence from a natural field experiment examining reactions to norm violations in multiethnic German neighborhoods. We uncover asymmetric patterns of norm enforcement in interethnic encounters: “Native” Germans are more active in sanctioning norm violations, while ethnic minorities are more likely to be targeted for sanctions. We link these dynamics to prevailing status inequalities between minorities and natives in German society. We further show that, as a consequence of such asymmetries, social control tends to rise with ethnic diversity.<br><hr>

    <div class="collapse" id="puncorrupt">Anti-corruption research has highlighted the potential for grassroots monitoring to improve governance outcomes, but the conditions under which citizens are willing to report bribery remain under-studied. Are individuals from some societies socialized into a “culture of corruption” that makes them more accepting of malfeasance, or is the failure to denounce wrongdoing simply a response to low-quality enforcement institutions? I conduct a laboratory experiment to examine how the propensity to report corruption differs between Northern and Southern Italians, two populations experiencing different levels of corruption in everyday life. For each group, I experimentally manipulate the quality of enforcement institutions. When given high-quality institutions, all participants are more willing to report corruption. Moreover, Southerners and Northerners behave similarly when placed within the same institutional environments. These results suggest that high-corruption societies are not “culturally” predisposed to tolerate malfeasance. Rather, improving the capacity of enforcement institutions may significantly strengthen accountability norms.<br><hr>

    <div class="collapse" id="legibility">Recent research in political science has stressed the importance of the state in curbing violence and promoting social and economic development, resulting in an explosion of scholarly interest in the foundations of state capacity. This article argues that state capacity depends in part on “legibility”—the breadth and depth of the state’s knowledge about its citizens and their activities—and that legibility is crucial to effective, centralized governance. We illustrate the importance of legibility through a novel argument linking legibility to the state’s role in curbing free-riding in collective action dilemmas. We then demonstrate this argument in the context of tax contributions to public goods using an original measure of legibility based on national population censuses. The article concludes by discussing how future research may leverage our indicator’s exceptional temporal and geographic coverage to advance new avenues of inquiry in the study of the state.<br><hr>

    <div class="collapse" id="plostax">As shown by the recent crisis, tax evasion poses a significant problem for countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy. While these societies certainly possess weaker fiscal institutions as compared to other EU members, might broader cultural differences between northern and southern Europe also help to explain citizens’ (un)willingness to pay their taxes? To address this question, we conduct laboratory experiments in the UK and Italy, two countries which straddle this North-South divide. Our design allows us to examine citizens’ willingness to contribute to public goods via taxes while holding institutions constant. We report a surprising result: when faced with identical tax institutions, redistribution rules and audit probabilities, Italian participants are significantly more likely to comply than Britons. Overall, our findings cast doubt upon “culturalist” arguments that would attribute cross-country differences in tax compliance to the lack of morality amongst southern European taxpayers.<br><hr>

However, we also uncover differences in national “styles” of dishonesty. Specifically, while Swedes are more likely to be either completely honest or completely dishonest in their fiscal declarations, Italians are more prone to fudging (i.e., cheating by a small amount).

This article investigates whether changing collective beliefs about how ‘most people in society’ will behave can reform prevailing cultural practices. Employing an economic experiment involving northern and southern Italian university students, this study shows that (costly) honest behavior can be sustained by conditional beliefs about the honesty of others. I also hypothesize that, given southern Italians’ reputation for corruption, informing participants that they are interacting with southerners should increase the level of bribery in the experiment. However, surprisingly, I find the opposite effect: when exposed to information about the identity of their fellow participants, southern Italians are not only less corrupt, but they are also more likely to believe that their counterparts are less corrupt. I discuss several explanations which may account for these unexpected findings. Overall, the paper provides theoretical foundations and experimental support for how new cultural practices might emerge.<br><hr>

    </div>
    <br>
  
    <p> Recent trends in global migration have raised public concerns about the potentially negative consequences of ethnic diversity for social solidarity in Western societies. Few studies to date however have sought to explain how trust and cooperation can conversely be sustained in diverse settings. Against this backdrop, the <b>Making Diversity Work</b> project aims to create novel behavioral indicators of social cohesion across multiethnic German neighborhoods in order to analyze the emergence of positive community relations. In contrast to existing studies which predominately privilege comparisons between ethnically-homogenous and heterogeneous areas, a key contribution of this project is to focus explicitly on important unexamined differences between highly-diverse contexts in order to understand the conditions under which diversity may undermine or, conversely, promote cooperation.</p>
      
    <p> Using innovative field experimental methods, this project will develop a sophisticated set of behavioral indicators to map variation in “prosocial” behavior across diverse urban areas. Further, this new data will be used to (i) systematically test novel theories about how different features of diverse neighborhoods contribute to local cooperation, (ii) disentangle the behavioral mechanisms – other-regarding preferences, social norms enforcement, and intergroup contact – underlying social cohesion in multiethnic settings, and (iii) develop a richer understanding of social relations that takes both natives’ and minorities’ experiences into account. Overall, results from this research will open up new scientific perspectives on cooperation in diverse communities and generate critical policy knowledge about how to “make diversity work" in an era of rapid demographic change.</p>

    </p>
    <div class="collapse" id="topics">
	(1) <b>Deprivation and Inequality</b>: previous research provides ample evidence of the negative effects of  neighborhood deprivation on the quality of local civic life.  That said, insufficient attention has been paid to the interaction between the <i>level</i> of deprivation and its <i>distribution</i> across ethnic lines.  How are intergroup interactions affected when ethnic differences also intersect with status inequalities?  Conversely, in comparison to encounters involving unequal status, are we more likely to observe cooperative or conflictual interactions between members of different low-status groups? 
	<br>
	<br>
	(2) <b>Minority Diversity and Group Size</b>: existing studies of diversity effects privilege comparisons of neighborhoods with varying shares of native residents, and thus largely overlook the impact of <i>immigrant diversity</i> on collective outcomes.  Yet intuitively, we might think that social relations would look different in neighborhoods dominated by a single minority vs. neighborhoods with many small groups.  Research along these lines might fruitfully investigate how the number and size of immigrant groups shapes both native-minority and minority-minority interactions in areas that, at least superficially, look similarly diverse with respect to native shares.
	<br>
	<br>
	(3) <b>Getting to Diversity</b>: social behavior in neighborhoods today may reflect different historical trajectories of demographic movement. For instance,  inter-group interactions may differ across (i) areas with longstanding minority and native communities, vs. (ii) those that recently became diverse as a result of minority in-migration and "white flight," vs. (iii) traditional minority enclaves that experience diversification as a result of gentrification.  In studying these differences across contexts, we can begin to illuminate how the process of "getting to diversity" matters for contemporaneous social relations.

    <button class="btn btn-link" data-target="#metro" data-toggle="collapse" type="button"><u>[Abstract]</u></button>
    </p>
    <div class="collapse" id="metro">A large scholarship documents discrimination against immigrants and ethnic minorities in institutional settings such as labor and housing markets in Europe. We know less, however, about discrimination in informal and unstructured everyday encounters.  To address this gap, we report results from a large-scale field experiment examining the physical avoidance of immigrants as an unobtrusive yet important measure of everyday discrimination in a large European metropolis. In addition to varying confederates’ migration background and race, we also vary signals of SES (business vs. casual attire) in order to shed light on the mechanisms underlying discriminatory patterns. We find that natives are averse to contact with Sub-Saharan African confederates, but do not discriminate against Chinese confederates. Further, manipulating confederates' socioeconomic status has little effect on natives' behavior. Triangulating our field experimental data with survey responses and results from an implicit association test (IAT), we conclude that physical avoidance in public spaces may belong to a class of "automatic associative and affective reactions" that govern inter-ethnic relations at the micro-level.  <br><hr>

    <div class="collapse" id="smithcomment">What is the relationship between classroom ethnic composition and patterns of ethnic friendship segregation amongst native and immigrant adolescents?  In a 2016 AJS article, Smith et al. analyzed data on adolescents' friendship networks from four European countries and found differential effects of classroom composition on natives' and immigrants' friendship choices. In this comment, we identify estimation problems in a large number of classroom networks included in Smith et al.'s original study. We demonstrate that immigrant homophily cannot be meaningfully estimated in many networks containing insufficient numbers of immigrant students from the same ethnic group. After accounting for these estimation problems at the network level, our re-analyis provides little evidence that classroom composition has differential effects for native and immigrant homophily.<br><hr>

    <div class="collapse" id="corruptionargentina">While a number of high-level figures around the world have been prosecuted and even jailed for corruption in recent years, we know little about how such anticorruption efforts shape public opinion and patterns of political engagement. To address this question, we examine natural experiments from Argentina and Costa Rica involving the unprecedented sentencing of two former Presidents on corruption charges. Exploiting the coincidence in timing between these cases and fieldwork on nationally-representative surveys, we find that citizens interviewed in the aftermath of these events paradoxically expressed lower trust in institutions and were less willing to vote or join in collective demonstrations. Overall, these findings suggest that high-profile efforts to punish corrupt actors may have similar effects as political scandals in shaping citizens' relationship to the political system.<br><hr>

    </p>
    <div class="collapse" id="minorityrepublicans">Although the GOP under Donald Trump has increasingly embraced the use of explicit rhetoric targeting racial and ethnic minorities, its support amongst minority voters has held steady in recent elections. Against this backdrop, we examine the racial attitudes of minorities within the Republican Party. Our research draws upon data from a large-scale original survey measuring Americans' reactions to racially-offensive speech.  We show that black, Latino and Asian respondents who identify with the GOP are significantly more tolerant of prejudice than their non-Republican counterparts, and hold attitudes largely in line with white Republicans.  These patterns obtain even when respondents are confronted with statements targeting their own racial group. Finally, Asian and Latino Republicans are relatively intolerant of statements expressing prejudice against whites.  Together,  these findings suggest that although the GOP’s stance on issues of race and ethnicity may alienate racially-liberal minorities, it may simultaneously prove attractive to racially-conservative Latinos and Asians for whom Republican identity can serve as an all-important signal of assimilation into the white mainstream.<br><hr>
