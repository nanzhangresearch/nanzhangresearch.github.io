### Review of Putnam

- What is social capital, how is it measured, and why is it important?

--

- How does ethnic diversity affect social capital?

  - What does **contact theory** predict?  Where does this prediction come from?

--
 
  - What about **conflict theory**?  

--

  - Can both theories be true?
  
--

- What is Putnam's big theoretical contribution to this debate?

--

  - Why does diversity cause people to "hunker down"?

--

- What data does Putnam use to support his theory?

---

### Herfindahl Index

.pull-left[
group       |  size in city 1   |   size in city 2
-           |   -               |   -
Asian       | 0.1               |   0.05
Black       | 0.1               |   0.07
Hispanic    | 0.3               |   0.13
White       | 0.5               |   0.75
]
 

.pull-right[
$$ 
Homogeneity = \sum_{i=1}^{N} groupsize_i^2
$$

$$
= 0.1^2 + 0.1^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.5^2 = 0.36
$$
]

&lt;br&gt;

Intuitively, the index captures the probability that two randomly selected people in the community are of the same race.

--

- What is the index value in city 2?

--

- The index is defined according to the 4-fold categorization.  If we classified people differently, "diversity" would change, even though "social reality" does not...

--

- Notice also that the index is "color-blind".   But are there reasons to think that different groups would be treated differently?

---

### Review of Putnam

- What do Figures 3 - 6 show?   

--

  - Why do they support Putnam's argument?

--

  - What would these graphs look according to contact theory?  To conflict theory?
  
--

  - What other measures of social capital does Putnam examine (but which are not graphed)?
  
--

  - **Do these patterns apply only to the US, or are more universal?** 

--

- What does Putnam mean by "compositional" and "contextual" effects?

---

### An Example

Imagine two schools: a homogeneous school with all Dutch students and a diverse school with half Dutch students and half Bolivian students.

Dutch people are, on average, the tallest people in the world. Bolivians are, on average, the shortest.

If we are studying student height, we would most likely find that students in the diverse school are shorter, on average, than students in the homogeneous school.

But it's ridiculous to argue that diversity **causes** students to be shorter.

Rather, we are looking at a **compositional** effect.

---

### Definitions

**Compositional effect**: there is something “sticky” about people (e.g. their personality or upbringing) that affects their attitudes and behavior. In other words, if we moved people to a new location, their attitudes and behavior would not change.

**Contextual effect**: there is something about a location (context) that causes people to think and behave differently. If we moved peoople to a new location, their attitudes and behavior would start to resemble those of the people in that new location.

--
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

- Is the constrict theory about compositional or contextual effects?   What about the other theories?

--

- What types of compositional effects might underlie the patterns we observe in Figures 3-5?


---

### Multivariate Results

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
- What does this table show?

- Why does Putnam control for race?

- Does controlling for race account for the fact that diversity could affect minorities differently than it affects whites?

- Does it matter that he did not control for political ideology (i.e. liberals vs conservatives)?
]

---

### Finishing off Putnam

- What is the concern with potential self-selection?  Why does Putnam dismiss it?

--

- What types of subgroup analyses does Putnam conduct?

--

  - Putnam finds that minorities respond (negatively) to diversity, just as whites do.  Why is this strange?
  
--

- What does Putnam mean by "comparative statics", and why might it be preferable to instead look at the "rate of change"?

### Choice of Geographic Unit

### Reminder on Course Aims

To identify a final paper topic to pursue as a research proposal.

1. The research question should succinctly describe the "state-of-the-art" (or what we do not yet know).

2. But the research question should also be framed in a way such that it could (eventually) be **empirically** answered.

The reading memos provide opportunities to practice formulating such research questions.

---

### Types of Research Questions

- **Positive** vs. **Normative** questions

  - *Should* men and women be paid equally?  
  
  - *Are* men and women paid equally?

--

- **Descriptive** vs. **Explanatory**  questions

  - *How much* more do men earn than women?
  
  - *Why* do men earn more than women?

--

- **Y-based**, **X-based** and **y = f(x)-based** questions

  - What causes differences in income (Y)?
  
  - What are the consequences of differences in education (X) for outcomes?

  - Do differences in education (X) cause differences in income (Y)?


---

### How can we rework the following questions?

--

1. Can distrust between ethnicities truly disappear?

2. Has American gotten worse since 2000 due to continuing immigration and increasing ethnic diversity?

3. Are there examples of wealthy countries where diversity is no longer a problem?

4. Do you believe societies can evolve towards an ideal where race is celebrated in the same way as ethnic diversity among white populations? 

5. Why do you think young people are less likely to react with lower trust levels than older people given an ethnically diverse environment? 

6. How can governments and communities respond to the challenges and opportunities of immigration and diversity?

7. To what extent are people willing to reconstruct their social identity in order to support ethnic diversity and immigration?

8. To what extent might cultural factors, such as the acceptance of diversity in a society, influence the impact of immigration and ethnic diversity on social capital?

###Next week

Please read [Enos 2017.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/p5hh6sy8tj742vivgvgop/Enos_Ch5.pdf?rlkey=iisfr2kc6rpn23pt2fj8nidir&amp;dl=0) *The Space Between Us: Social Geography and Politics.*  **Chapter 5.**

In your reading memo:

- Summarize the main arguments and findings of in .pink[one paragraph]

- In a .pink[second paragraph]: please raise 1 or 2 **y = f(x)-based** questions about the reading that you would like to discuss in class.

Memos (max 1 page, or approx. 300 words) should be submitted to me via [email](mailto:n.zhang@uni-mannheim.de) by **8:00am on the Wednesday (20 Sept)** immediately before class. *No late memos will be accepted!*

Please use the subject line: **ci_firstname_lastname_memo#**.
